# Sedona Method 1992 Release Technique Volume 5

## Beginning

(00:00:10)

Jim:  
This is the beginning of volume two. We're going to take releasing a giant step further. Up to this point, we have been feeling our now feeling, tracing it back to apathy, grief, fear, lust, anger and pride, or a courageousness, acceptance, and peace, and then letting it go.

As I'm sure you can see, there are tremendous benefits. And letting go of your now feeling. What we'll be doing next will greatly enhance your ability to release. In this volume, you'll complete the learning of the release technique. And once you have the complete picture, again, you will see that this is an even more powerful and effective way to let go of those limitations that control you.

**Hale:**
Well, welcome back. I'm glad to see you all here this morning. And welcome back those of you who have taken a few days break with the tape. Whatever benefits you've noticed so far with releasing are about to be greatly accelerated. What we do in the first four tapes and the first weekend of the course, is we basically show you how to start tapping your natural ability to let go. But what we'll be doing now is really, in these next four tapes, in these next two days, is really developing the release technique. This is the nuts and bolts of what it's all about, whatever benefits you receive so far, and whatever power you've noticed in the release technique, what we do now for the next two days of next four tapes, is thousands of times more effective.

So, if you've seen benefit so far, just wait for what's about to unfold. Now, I'd rather than explain a lot about how we're going to be doing something different, what I'm going to do now is work with someone here, and just allow you to watch along with them as they're releasing, and you'll start to get a sense of what will be doing differently. And it might be someone from this group, or it might be someone from another group that we've already previously recorded.

## Case
### Case – Barbara
(00:02:06)
**Barbara:**  
So, I ended up with this colitis attack today. I don't know, except that I have had some strong feelings, and I haven't given myself time to release. On these Judge Thomas the need to hell. Think it's made me very angry and sick to my stomach. And that's the strongest things like that. And I was listening to that this morning, so maybe that's why. I don't know. 

**Hale:** 
See if there's any feeling about them.

**Barbara:**  
Well, I'm angry just about that.

**Barbara:**  
I just. 

**Hale:** 
Let yourself feel that now feeling of anger.

Can you feel it?

**Barbara:**  
Yeah, 

**Hale:**  
Right. Does it. Does it? But is it a wanting approval or a wanting to control?

Rather was it? You're letting it go and show them what it was. What was it? 

**Barbara:**  
I suppose it must have been wanting to control. And as soon as I thought, there's no way you can control that.

**Hale:**  
I know, just do it. (laughter) Alright, see if there’s any more. Can see if you can become aware of any more of your wanting to control about that situation.

**Barbara:**  
Hey, I can say to myself, I want to control. I don't like this, and if it'll all come that well.

**Hale:**  
Well, just look at them, just see if there's any more that wanted to control.

**Barbara:**  
Well, I'm trying to come to it alright so.

**Hale:**  
And I know you're really good. It was crazy. All right, so see, how do you feel now about it?

**Barbara:**  
I feel ok about it.

**Hale:**  
Yes. 

**Barbara:**  
to the next time I listen to someone, 

**Hale:**  
think of just review those that review what you saw this morning. See what you're feeling in this bed.

**Barbara:**  
Yeah, everybody started. 

**Hale:**  
Okay? Well, we as soon as you saw it was wanting to control, it just released. You actually held it back a little bit, otherwise you would have released more.

**Barbara:**  
See, I should do that. I haven't been doing that. I've been asking myself those questions, 

**Hale:**  
I know, because it's the first time I brought it off.

#讲解 Hale
(00:04:26)

Now, I think you noticed that I did something very different than what we were doing before the first segment of the course, the first four tapes of the first, two days. And when you're practicing in between, you letting go, you're getting in touch with what you're feeling in the moment, you're tracing it to the underlying emotion. And then you letting go of the emotion.

All every emotion culminates in just two wants, the wanting approval and the wanting to control. And as we work this weekend, we'll be working on just those two wants.

And you see, as you focus on those two wants and start to let those go, you'll see that your releasing is greatly accelerated.

By the way, something very important, want equates to lack. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being in control. There's nothing wrong with loving or having approval. The problem is we're always wanting it, and when we're wanting it, we're holding it away.

So, what we'll be doing is letting go of that wanting approval and that wanting to control. And as we do that, you'll see whatever you've achieved so far with releasing will be greatly accelerated. And you also notice that when I ask the questions, I'll be just saying, “could you”. Because the “would you” and the one is really not necessary with the approval and control, you see, as you start to become aware of your wanting approved, control, even more than with the emotions, you'll have a tendency to just let it go.

It's like you'll notice you're wanting the control, and it will (手展开的姿势) and it's just gone. Because it's natural. It's a natural part of us to let go of our wanting approval and wanting to control once it's identified.

So, who else has a something they'd like to release?

Case

Case - Cheryl/Hale
(00:06:07)
Cheryl: 
I've noticed that I'm very judgmental, and I find myself em…… putting people into stereotypical categories quite rapidly, and I don't like that. I'd like to get rid of that.

**Hale:**  
Okay. And as you talk about that, just see what feeling it stirs up. 

Cheryl: 
When I feel bad at myself for doing it, kind of like I want to decide what everybody should do or be, a pair of feeling but it's judgmental.

**Hale:**  
Okay. And where would you put?

Actually, we live our lives in wanting instead of having, and then we're always denying ourselves a tremendous amount because of that wanting.

So, if you're willing to start letting go of the wanting, you'll see that you have more and more of everything that you've been striving for so long. The striving is actually keeping it away.

So, it's important to start focusing on that wanting approval and that wanting to control that's there all the time and start letting it go.

And by the way, as you, as we get into working on the wanting approval and the wanting to control, you'll probably notice you're starting to have many insights and realizations about your life, about how you've handled things. Please take the time to write them down because you'll be able to work with those.

You'll catch yourself the next time you're in a situation where you've been, it's been a long-standing area. We've been really wanting to control it. And because you've written it down and started to focus on it, you remember to release. And you'll see that as you release the wanting approval, and wanting to control whatever situation in your life that's been locked into a certain pattern can start to shift.

By the way, when we're wanting approval, and wanting to control, we very often don't see that when it's appropriate to take action, when it's not, when we're wanting to control, we're very often acting when it's totally inappropriate, and stopping ourselves from acting when it is appropriate because of that want, the want, again, because that want really equates to lack.

We find ourselves saying and doing things that create the lack of approval or create the lack of control. A typical example, of course, is sales. When you're in a sales type situation, you know very often it's time to keep quiet.

And what do you do? You start talking because you get uncomfortable with the silence you want. An approval comes up, or you wanting to control comes up. You're trying to make them buy something, and then you do the exact wrong thing to make the deal.

So, wanting approval and wanting to control are getting in our way all the time. And they're always easy to let go of if you decide to.

Case – Jack
(00:08:43)
Jack: 
I've been, one of the things I was working on was this approval and releasing that approval, and people that are a close to me, I was releasing approval with those particular people in a comment this morning.

Jack: 
Well, I was, excuse me.

**Hale:**  
Sorry, Bailey, try to get through the story, just let it come up.

Jack, just let it up. I said, it's your wanting approval come out.

Could you just let it go?

Jack: Yes.

**Hale:**  Just let more want to come up. (可能有)

**Hale:**  Couldn't you just allow it to release?

Jack: Yes. 

**Hale:**  Okay, see if you can get some more.

Jack: Yes. 

**Hale:**  Are you aware of the wanting approval?

Jack: I bring my son. 

**Hale:**  OK. Could you allow it to release?

Jack: Yes, I can.

**Hale:**  Okay, aware more of it. 

Jack: Yes.

**Hale:**  Is it release?

Jack: Yeah, yes.

**Hale:**  
Okay, just let yourself become aware more of it.

Is it releasing?

Jack: Slow. (maybe)

**Hale:**  
yeah. Okay. Are you wanting to make it go faster?

There were wanting to get through with faster.

OK Is that the wanting to control? 

Jack: Probably. 

**Hale:**  
Do that just release?

Yeah. They go. Okay, 

Jack: Thank you.

**Hale:**  
Okay, now you, uh, you go ahead and finish talking about it.

Okay, it might just bring more of it up.

Jack: 
Yeah. What it was, was, I was waiting for approval for my grandparents.

They're both gone. And so, the difficulty that I was having releasing with the people I was looking for approval with, and was the fact that it was deeper than that, and it was the approval or two people who I love very dearly, and I didn't realize that this morning.

**Hale:**  
Right. Okay, so this is more right there now.

Right. Okay, could you just allow it to release?

Jack: Yes. 

**Hale:**  All right, just become more aware of, just allow yourself to become aware of the wanting approval. And just allow it to release. 

Jack: Yeah, I'm going to that's tingly stupid.

**Hale:**  Okay, how is it now? 

Jack: 
I feel much better.

Much better, some though, just, there's not much left.

**Hale:**  
See if you can just let the rest of it come into your awareness.

Just allow it to release. 

How is that?

Jack: It's leaving. 

**Hale:**  Okey.

Jack: Yeah, very good, very good. 

**Hale:**  Did you say that's a gain?

Jack: Yes, I'm very real in the down here. But there was on top of that.

Guidance
(00:12:38)
**Hale:**  
OK, what we'll be doing now is, we'll be giving you at home an opportunity to do some releasing as well on this new way, with this new way of releasing.

And those of you here, as we've been doing before, it's important to release along as I'm helping the home viewer, you can be releasing in your chairs.

So now, just allow yourself. We can start now with a feeling since that's where we started last weekend. So just allow yourself to become aware of your now feeling.

It's an apathy, grief of fear, lost, anger, pride, whatever it is, just allow yourself to become aware of your now feeling.

But take it a little deeper and see if you can just become aware of whether it's coming from a wanting approval or a wanting to control.

Could you let go of that wanting approval with that wanting to control?

Now, just allow yourself to focus inside again and become aware if there's any more of the wanting approval or wanting to control there right now.

Could you allow it to release? Could you?

Take another look inside and just allow yourself to focus on your now want, whatever it is, either the wanting approval, or the wanting to control. And remember, we're just letting go of the wanting.

Could you let it go? 

Now, let's keep going with this a little while longer. Just allow yourself if you need to. You can think of a specific situation that you've already been working on that you might still have some feeling about, and let's see if we can start getting in touch with the underlying want that's causing that situation to be a problem.

So, as you think about that specific situation, just see which want it stirred up in the moment. Now, sometimes it's a combination of both, but see which one you more aware of, either the wanting approval or the wanting to control.

Could you let it go?

Now, just allow yourself to become aware of more that wanting in the moment, the wanting approval or the wanting to control.

Could you allow it to release? 

Now, just allow yourself to become aware of more that wanting approval or wanting to control.

And remember, if you notice that as you become aware of it, you're just letting it go before I even ask the question, or you ask it of yourself, that's okay. That's a normal part of the process. It's natural. 

So just allow yourself to become aware of your whatever you're wanting in the moment, the wanting approval, or the wanting to control, 

And could you let it go?

OK. Now, I think you can see this new way of releasing can be extremely powerful. And just a few releases, you notice yourself getting a lot quieter. But whatever your initial experiences of using this technique, remember, this is just the beginning. It's something new. It might take you a little while to get used to the letting go at this deeper level, this more powerful way of letting go. But just be easy with yourself.

And also make sure you take time to write down your gains and realizations. You will start to see a lot as you focus on this wanting approval and wanting to control. And as you can continue letting go of it, you'll start to see that anything is possible.

(Please pause the videotape and continue releasing. Make sure you write down your gains. Continue when you are ready.)

Gains
(00:17:48)
Chip (Graduate 1991): 
The Sedona method has been extremely beneficial in a business sense, in that I-I am not so, um, fearful, I guess, afraid to approach people, potential clients, about projects or about work.

I don't live and die with everything might possibly come about in the business. In a business standpoint, uh, I just I-I can go in much more calmly and and speak with people. Uh, again. I don't live or die with their decision.

If, if things work out fine, if they don't, you know, something else is going to to turn up. And it always has. And I find that it's turning up a lot more frequently now than it than it did in the past.

And so, I-I it just has given me confidence, I think, confidence in myself, in my in my own ability. And, uh, and it's paid off.

Rest
(00:18:49)
**Hale:**  
So, we'll be taking a break in a moment. But what I like you to do is to use the time to start looking for the wanting approval and wanting to control, so you can start letting it go.

(Please pause the videotape and take a short break. Remember to keep releasing. Make sure you write down your gains. Continue when you are ready.)

Gains
(00:19:11)
Cheryl: 
Last week, I have released on...... the fact that feelings will instantaneously change my mood and my attitude towards others or towards myself.

And I noticed during the week that while that would still happen sometimes, immediately, I'd notice it, and then I could release that whatever was going on right then. And that, to me, was a very big gain, because I didn't have to stay stuck in that. So, I thought really good about that. That was very nice. 

Worksheet “REMEMBER”
 
图表 1 Worksheet "Remember"
(00:19:39)
**Nikki:**  
So now we're going to be working on a worksheet in your book, and you will need workbook No.2 for this. So, if you haven't got it out already, make sure that you just pull that out, and turn to the page that says "remember" at the top.

This worksheet is going to help you to start to get in touch with the wanting approval and the wanting to control. And what we're going to do is have you think of specific instances that you wanted approval or that you wanted to control. We have a lot of those in our lives, but there will be wants that come to mind, with mind for you, whether it was last week or years ago.

So, we're just going to take some time now for you to write down those specific instances.

(Please pause the videotape to write down some specific instances where you wanted approval and where you wanted to control. Continue when you are ready.)

Now that you've written some instances down where you wanted approval and wanting-wanted to control, let me just explain how to use this worksheet.

What you'll be doing is focusing on that specific time, e.g. (for example) there's an example here at the party. You'll be thinking of that time and seeing what gets stirred up, which want get stirred up when you think about that specific time, either the wanting approval or the wanting to control.

For instance, the example here says, regarding the party, I wanted them to like me. Well, that would be coming from the wanting approval. And so, what you'll be doing is focusing on the wanting approval, or the wanting to control, allowing that to release to completion, then checking that off on your Let Go column, and carrying on until you've let go of all of the wanting approval and all of the wanting to control and until you feel good about that incident.
 

So, let's do some work on this together now. So those of you at home remember to keep releasing along whether I'm working with somebody here, or or you're watching somebody releasing from another class.

Case

Case – Dana
(00:21:56)
Dana: 
Yet under the approval. I could when I said I had taken a new job, I have to tell everybody about it to see how they feel about it.

And I guess that's wanting approval.

Um. I feel fine about it now, though.

**Hale:**  Through releasing?

Dana: Yeah. 

**Hale:**  Okay, so once you give me another way. 

Dana: For approval, there's not really a whole lot I find that I want to control a lot.

**Hale:**  Okay, so you're not really, we can't think of one right now you're having. 

Dana: For approval, not really, huh-uh, for control. Um. 

**Hale:**  Okay. 

Dana: When I had to sign a new lease just the other day, I went in there very determined that I was going to get the better of the deal.

Um. So, I wanted to control the situation.

It actually worked out good in my favor, but, um, so I don't know whether that's negative or positive.

I wanted to control, and I did.

**Hale:**  Yeah, sometimes we sometimes get good with the wanting to controls are doing something positive.

Anyway, go see if you can, uh, because let yourself feel any of your wanting to control.

Dana: MHM 

**Hale:**  Okay, could you allow it to release? 

Dana: MHM 

**Hale:**  Okay. 

Dana: What I find was that at least that particular situation, I felt good about it, but I also felt kind of pushy about it too.

So, 

**Hale:**  Yeah, 

Dana: not that that's really negative, but yeah, 

**Hale:**  Walking under a sense of any of the pushing is right now?

Dana: Yeah. 

**Hale:**  Okay. And is that the wanting to control?

Dana: Yeah. 

**Hale:**  And you released on it?

Dana: Yeah. (laugh) And that's really good.

Yeah, and that's, that's a real drive in me, the wanting- wanting to control.

That feels good to be in control.

**Hale:**  Right. When you let it go.

You have anyone noticed that you feel more in control when you have go?

Mind? Yeah. 

Dana: Yeah. 

Case – Terry
(00:23:48)
**Hale:**  Yes. Okay, Terry......

Terry: I'm releasing. (laughter)

**Hale:**  Okay, (can't listen) did you mind tell us what you are releasing on?

Terry: Sure......(can't listen)

Now, I wrote down two things for approval, but I think they, they statement just the one.

I need my mother's approval about everything, as far as I want her to see me as an adult, you know.

And, uh, um, but I just thought, covers it, um, just from time of the teenager, well, actually all my life, I guess, just so like seeking that.

**Hale:**  And are you aware of......

Terry: Yeah, uh, aware of some what?

**Hale:**  What can you , uh, can you, what can you feeling?

The wanting of approval? 

Terry: Oh no. I've been letting it go all the whole time.

**Hale:**  Um, we'll see if there's any left right now of that wanting approval.

Terry: You don't know...... 

**Hale:**  Okay, could you allow it to release?

Terry: (点头)

**Hale:**  Good. Okay, now. Well, think of your mother again.

Terry: MHM ...... This is really nice.

**Hale:**  Okay, what about the control?

Terry: This was a really trying time for me when we moved, um, this first time I was controlling everything, you know, other moves I'd do with my folks or what not.

This is, you know, me as an adult, and I guess this is wanting approval also.

I went to when everybody is senior, as an adult, but I wanted everything to work.

And I think our benefits

don't know if that wanted to control everything.

Went everything to just to go by clockwork.

And, uh, it eventually worked out.

You know it? Uh, there are some trying times that.

**Hale:**  So see if you can allow yourself to be aware of some of you want to control.

Terry: Oh, I needed this three months ago. (laughter)

**Hale:**  Yeah, you just as soon as you're allowed to come into awareness such as these.

Terry: And one other was, once we finally got here, neither one of us has a job.

Um, that was really stressful. We only had like $200, you know, and, um, we had just pay for rent and everything.

So we were good for a month.

But, you know, it took me a couple of weeks to find a job.

Actually, I take that back. It took me about three days.

And I got the job at Butterfields.

And but my husband didn't go job for six weeks.

So that, you know, even though I had some income coming in, he didn't have any income coming in, and that was really in care of time.

**Hale:**  So then said that stir up your wanting to control.

Can you allow you something to be aware of, something in them?

Terry: Oh, wow. 

**Hale:**  That's you're released, right? (laughter)

Terry: Nice. 

**Hale:**  Okay, now just see if there's any more.

Just think of that situation again.

Terry: I just let it go. Oh, is so much better.

**Hale:**  Take my check, one more check, and this check, the situation.

Okay? So you can you let it all go, and you probably feel okay.

So you could give yourself two checks.

Case – Jack
(00:28:12)
Jack: I think this is something that's been a long way back, and that's wanting approval from my father, and that carries over into other relationships too.

And, uh, so are you? Uh, I feel great about it right now.

I just, I was going listening and going through this, and the thoughts went back in, and I could visualize my parents sitting where they normally sit most of the day now.

And I don't feel like I have their approval, but I also don't feel like it.

It makes a pretty bit of difference anymore.

**Hale:**  Okay.

Jack: I can't feel good about it.

**Hale:**  Good.

Jack: Good. 

**Hale:**  Good. 

Jack: Now. Do you feel loving toward that?

Jack: Yes, very much. Sweet.

**Hale:**  That's ok. When you totally let go of your wanting approval, you feel loved and it doesn't matter what the other person does.

Jack: Yes. Do you feel that? 

**Hale:**  Right.

Good. I'll give you some two checks for, uh, letting it all go and feeling okay.

That's just good. 

Jack: Again. It's control.

I've gone through all my life where, uh, just work hard, never worried about anything, and, uh, money was always there.

That I reached the stage of my life where money wasn't there any And the frustrations are willing to control that situation, get it back under control, and to-to handle it.

And I feel a greater peace today that I have done a long time.

**Hale:**  Okay, this evening, you become aware of some of the wanting to control. We're waiting to that.

You just released on it. (laughter), 

Jack: I think the feeling is center on it...... 

**Hale:**  Right.

Thing is, releasing takes no effort. All the effort that we spend all day long is all the effort that we're expanding to hold on.

When you go with the river, there's no effort.

But when you resist the river, you swim upstream, it's a lot of work, so when you stop, when you let go, you just go with flow.

There's no effort. Zero. 

Jack: See, yesterday, I was going through some blockages, and last night through some blockches, and I was, I mean, I was forcing, I was pushing at this.

That's what happened, 

**Hale:**  Was that something wanting to control the process? 

Jack: Very much so, and I......

**Hale:**  Could see, think it would become aware that Now, 

Jack: That's all right.

Jack: I can't. 

**Hale:**  You know, you always get your head here. (laughter)

That'll be just let it go anyway. (laughter)

Jack: That's it. (laugh) 

**Hale:**  Yeah, good, terrific. 

Jack: I know.

**Hale:**  That's good. I guess you get two more check.

Jack: Yeah.

I got those there. 

Case – Kathy
(00:31:33)
Kathy: Okay, my approval was just Monday, I held a leadership class, and and in the business that I'm in, my husband and I were at the top level of our group, and so it was basically our leadership class that we were holding.

And so I was wanting approval from we're into edifying each other, And so I-I was wanting approval from the people that were there for the job that I was going to be doing in the class.

**Hale:**  (laugh) There goes. 

Kathy: Anyway, I think I had released quite a bit of that. So……

**Hale:**  Okay, I just check to see if there’s anymore.

Just put yourself back in that situation and see if you become aware more of that want.

Is it release? 

Kathy: I think it's, I think it's gone.

**Hale:**  Okay, so give yourself. I guess that's a two checker.

Okay, what was the control one?

Kathy: Okay. Saturday night. Um. This also deals with my business.

UM, we were planning for the leadership class on Monday.

And, um, the person that, UH, is directly underneath us, in in line.

It's like a-a line of people, uh, she gave her opinion of what she felt needed to take place at that meeting, and, um (laughter), 

**Hale:**  It goes, 

Kathy: Oh, I really thought I'd released on that one before, but I might be in a way.

**Hale:**  Oh, that's what I did. Check Anyway.

Kathy: Okay, yeah, I think you do.

**Hale:**  Okay, let you check it. 

Kathy: I hope you don't mind if I continue to release throughout them.

**Hale:**  No, I certainly don't mind. (laughter) 

Kathy: I don't know if it’s fine this way, better than crying.

**Hale:**  Very good. And I said. 

Guidance
(00:34:02)
**Nikki:**  
And those of you at home, let's get comfortable and pick something off of your list that either stirred up, you know, the specific time it stirred up your wanting approval or wanting to control.

And when you think of that time, just allow yourself to be aware of whatever want it stirs up.

Could you allow it to release? 

And just see if there's any more of it there, whichever want it is.

Could you allow yourself to let it go?

Think of that specific time again, see which want is there now, is it the wanting approval or the wanting to control?

Could you let go of either wanting approval or wanting to control? 

Just focus on that again. Whichever want it was. 

Could you allow it to release?

Think of that specific time again. Just allow yourself to be aware of whatever want is right there now, about that. 

Whatever it is. Could you let it go? 

And just check again, see if there's any more of that want there, or the other. 

And could you allow it to release? 

You're probably feeling a lot better about that time or incident now. Give yourself a check in the “Let Go” column and “Feel Good”.

Let's just focus on another specific. So, pick something else off of your list, another time that stirred up your wanting approval or wanting to control.

And if you're more aware of a feeling there, first, that's okay, but just trace it to that underlying want.

And now that you're aware of that, could you allow it to release?

And just check again. Allow yourself to be aware of more of that there.

Could you allow yourself to let it go?

Think of that specific again, and you'll see what want is there right now in the moment. 

Could you let it go? 

And just check, see if there's any more there. 

Could you allow it to release?

Now, I’m gonna let you continue on your own but do make sure that you continue to completion. Just making sure and carrying on releasing until you feel good about that specific time, that specific instance, and then make a note of it in your Gains Book.

(Please pause the videotape and continue releasing. Make sure you write down your gains. Continue when you are ready.)

Well, this brings us to the conclusion of this tape, and I just want to let you know that if you're still having a little difficulty adapting to the wanting approval, wanting to control, we're in a transition phase.

If you see that you're switch back to focusing on feelings, or you feel more comfortable identifying a feeling first. Don't worry about that. As you practice, you'll see that it gets easier and easier to just go right to the wanting approval and wanting the control, and the more you do that, the faster you move.

Also get in the habit of making release in constant. The more you practice releasing throughout your day, you'll be, you'll be moving forward more quickly. 

And also, if the bigger issues come up, if life presents you with a real challenge, and you've been releasing that whole day or for a long period of time, and then something unexpected happens, you'll be right there, ready to just let go of whatever is brought up.

And also, if you notice that you have a tendency to want to kind of swept back to the way you were before, don't worry about it. It's a normal thing.

If you remember last week I talked about the fisherwoman. There's also another story that kind of illustrates that she can tell. I like to tell stories, but, uh, in a little, in a little way, we're, we're all little like cage birds. It's, again, funny, I guess it's a funny analogy, but what we're doing on these tapes is we're learning to, we have the key now to get out of the cage.

Now, at first, last weekend, at first, we had the cage door open, and sometimes you were probably staring at it, going, I don't know if I even want to go out. It's like, I know I can get out of this cage, but I don't know if I want to do it.

You know, you might have noticed that this week, as you were practicing the technique, that at times, you know, you knew you could let go and said, get it. I'm not going. I'm staying in the cage. I don't care if there's poop this high in the gate, I'm staying here. I'm used to it. 

And then what happens as you keep practicing with the technique, as you keep letting go, you'll start to fly out of the cage, and you, Wow, this feels really great. But then you go, wait a minute. It's unfamiliar out here. I better go back in. And you'll find yourself rushing back into the cage and slamming the door.

But again, that's okay. Again. It's a normal part of the process because you know how the key, the the release technique is to keep that cage, to keep it open, that door, so even if you find yourself running back into the cage, you you'll, you'll have the key to get out.

And as you keep doing it, you'll get fine, you'll get comfortable, and you'll say, you know what? Enough with the cage. I'm just going to let it go. I'm going to allow myself to have the new freedom. I'm going to allow myself to have that imperturbability.

So, if if you notice yourself occasionally going back, don't worry about it. Also, you might have noticed this week, as you've been practice, in practicing with technique, that occasionally your friends or relatives got a little nervous seeing you flying outside of the cage.

They're going, wait a minute. I'm still in the cage. What are you doing out there? And they probably, at times, they may even try to do things to get you to fly back into your cage.

Now, if that happens, don't worry about it. It's, again, and it's again normal for people around you that first feel a little threatened, because, hey, you know, they were used to the you being in that little confined box.

But as you keep letting go, and you keep releasing, you'll see that they'll go, wait a minute. What are you doing? How can I get out of my cage? And they'll want to join you.

So just to remember, it allowed to be easy. Keep keep focusing on the wanting approval and wanting to control. 

Practice, practice, practice. And release, release, release.

And now let's take a break and give you some time to focus on your release.


Gains
(00:42:58)
Michael: 
I remember the first week thinking that, yeah, this is pretty cool.

I can handle this. I got control of everything.

But once we got into wanting approval, I realized that I've been living my life that way, and it has made all the difference.

You know, that was like the missing piece.

It was the clue. It was the gas in the car.

Conclusion
(00:43:25)
Jim: 
It's important to make releasing the two wants a continuous habit. If you want to reach imperturbability, you must make releasing the two wants a full-time activity. The more constantly release, the faster your life will change for the better.

The whole concept of letting go of wants, if shared out of context, can really hold people back.

Encourage anyone interested in experiencing the release technique to do it for themselves with their own tapes and workbooks.

Make sure you take at least an hour and a half to practice this new way of releasing before beginning the next tape. Please take at least an hour and one-half break before viewing Volume 2, Session 6

Make sure you write down your gains.
