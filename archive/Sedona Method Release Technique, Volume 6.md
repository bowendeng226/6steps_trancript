Rodney:
In class, we got focused on our relaxation with re leaving tension and getting more done at work, where I have a tremendous amount to do.

And my whole state of mind last week was better, and my productivity was up.

I figured up at least 20 %, which is, which is a very good big sound, already already a very efficient and productive person.

And I felt I had better cooperation from the people that I was working with.

My boss on Friday came and told me he was to buy me a new computer, a 386, instead of a 286, which will process things faster.

And somebody had even noticed that my handwriting it improved more than that, but that it would just it looked preer, that the flutters were more symmetrical.

So, all in all, I had a good week, and my energy level was excellent.

I was getting sleeping about 6 hours a night and not feeling tired at all.

So is a successful weekend when I hope it duplicates next week.

Beginning 
(00:02:11)
Hale: 
Well, welcome back from the break. I'm sure you've had some good practicing of using the release technique. What we're going to do now is review what we've done up until this point.

So, if you don't have it out already, take out your large chart of emotions.

And as you remember last weekend, what we were doing is we were identifying our now feeling, we were tracing it to the underlying fear or grief, or apathy, underlying emotion, and then letting it go. Because every time you let go of a little bit of grief, you will letting go of a little bit of all the feelings underneath it.

Now, what we've been doing is we've been letting go of the wanting approval and the wanting to control.

Now, if you take a moment and write in wanting approval and wanting to control up here, see these little boxes. So, take a moment here in the class, and also at home, write in the wanting approval wanting to control.

(Please pause the videotape to add “wanting approval” and “wanting to control” to your large chart of emotions. Continue when you are ready.)

What we'll be doing for the rest of the class is would be focusing on the two underlying wants that all the feelings culminate in. So, every time you let go of a little bit of the wanting approval and the wanting to control, you letting go a little bit of all of this.

And that's why the results will be even more effective than anything you've experienced up until this point. Because as you letting go of the wanting approval, wanting to control, you're undoing all limitation, all of the uncomfortable feelings, all the things that are holding you back from having whatever it is that you want in your life.

So, keep it going, keep focusing on those two wants. If feelings do come up, that's okay. That's don't you know, you don't have to push them back down. But remember the Take it a little deeper and focus on the underlying wanting approval and wanting the control. As you do that, you'll see the results really accelerate.

图表 2 Letting Go of Wants
We'll be working now in our workbooks, on the page that says; “Letting Go of Wants”. So, turn in your workbook to the pages says; “Letting Go of Wants”.

Now, what we've been did up until this point, like last weekend when we worked on goals in the in the last couple of tapes ago, is we've been focusing on what we want, letting go of our feelings to the contrary, and seeing that it does come in a lot easier.

Well, there's a much more powerful way of creating what you choose in your life, and that's actually letting go of the wants.

In fact, it's our conflicting wants that cause all our suffering. Because we want certain things, and at the same time we don't want them.

When we get stuck, also when we're wanting, it's blocking us from having. We all have long list of things we've probably been wanting a very long time, and they never seem. They always seem to be just a little out of our reach. And that's because want equates to lack.

So, what we'll be doing now is making a list of some of the things in our lives that we'd like to have, some of our wants and some of the things that we're wanting to get rid of, some of the things that we don't want.

So, take a moment or two, those of you at home and those of you here, to write down some of the things that you want and some of the things that you don't want.

(Please pause the videotape and write down some things that you want, and some things that you don’t want. Continue when you are ready.)

Okay, well, let's do some work on it together. And those of you at home, you can start releasing now. You don't have to wait till it's your turn.

And also remember that sometimes we'll be viewing people from this class and sometimes will be viewing people from other classes.

Case
Case – Cheryl
(00:05:43)
Hale: So, who has a-a want that they'd like to let go of?

Cheryl: Yes, I'm happy to. 

Hale: 
OK, all right, so are you aware of that want right now?

Right dig a little deeper.

And see which underlying want is coming from, the wanting approval or the wanting to control.

That would be wanting to control. 

Hale: Okay, so just allow yourself to become aware of the wanting to control.

Cheryl: Okey.

Hale: Did you let go some of it? 

Cheryl: Yes. 

Hale: Okay.

And just allow more of it to come up.

Now, again, you notice that Nikki and I will more and more, just allow you to do your own releasing.

Will kind of help you, point you in that direction.

And then you'll, you'll probably let it go before we even ask you anything.

See, you're doing it again, (laugh) just like all more of it.
Case – Michael
(00:06:39)
Hale: 
Yeah, that feels pretty good, really?

So, feels better? 

Michael: Yeah. Feels a lot better now.

Hale: Right.

Hale: Great. Give yourself a couple of checks.
引导
(00:07:07)
Hale:
Good. Okay. Now I would suggest that those of you here can continue releasing along as I work with a person at home.

So now it's your turn. And I remember, I can't emphasize this enough, there's nothing wrong with having. What we're doing is letting go of the wanting. The more you let go of the wanting, the more you free to have whatever does you choose in your life. Plus it really frees up a tremendous amount inside to not have that wanting inside of you.

So now, just focus on one of the items on your wist. Let's start with something that you're wanting.

And as you focus on it, see which want its coming from, the wanting approval or the wanting to control.

Now, could you allow it to release the wanting approval or the wanting to control?

Now focus on that same item again, and just see which want it stirs up in the moment.

Now, could you allow yourself to let go of that want?

Again, focus on that thing that you're wanting, and just see whether it's coming from the wanting approval and the wanting to control. 

And as you become aware of it, see if you can just allow yourself to let it go.

Focus on that item again, and just see if there's any more remaining wanting there. Either a wanting approval or wanting to control.

And could you allow yourself to let it go?

No, focus again on the item one more time, and just allow yourself to become aware of which want it stirs up in the moment.

And could you let go of that wanting approval or that wanting to control?

Now, I'm going to go on to something that you don't want, but if you need to do some more work on this particular item, you might want to pause a tape for a moment before we move forward.

So now focus on something that you're not wanting, something that you wanting to avoid, and again, just allow yourself to become aware of which want it stirs up in the moment. Could you let it go? 

Focus on the item again, and just allow yourself to become aware of what you're wanting in the moment. Could you do allow that want to release? 

And just invite up more of whatever you wanting in relations to that item, Just invite it to come up into your awareness, and remember, you don't even have to wait for me to ask you the question if it comes up. And it leaves that totally okay.

So again, focus on the item. Focus on that thing that you're not wanting. Just a while, the wanting approval or the wanting to control to come into your awareness, and then just allow it to release with ease.

Now focus on the item again, that thing you're not wanting, and just allow yourself to become aware of your now want, and then just easily decide to let it go.

Now, I suggest you continue working on the sheet for as long as it takes and work through many items.

Again, it is extremely powerful to start letting go of wanting, not just the wanting approval and wanting control, but whatever you're wanting in your life. The more you let go of wanting, the more you can have and also the more you can feel imperturbable moment to moment. Cause, no matter what is going on around you, if you're not being pulled or pushed by conflicting wants, you can be more at ease.

(Please pause the videotape and continue releasing. Make sure you write down your gains. Continue when you are ready.)

(Please take a short break. Remember to keep releasing. Make sure you write down your gains. Continue when you are ready.)

Worksheet – Wanting to Control
(00:12:43)
 
图表 3 Wanting to Control
 
Nikki: 
So welcome back class. Welcome back. Those of you at home, hope you enjoyed your break and kept releasing during your break.

We're going to work now on a workshop in your book. So please turn to the page that has; “Wanting to Control” at the top of it.

What we're going to be doing here is exploring the wanting to control further. And by doing it on this sheet, we're going to be looking at two main things.

The first thing, what is it that we actually get from wanting to control? We do it for a reason. So, what is it we're wanting?

And the other reason, on the other side, really, the side that's not quite as obvious, is what do we get from wanting to be controlled?

And you might think that's kind of a little strange, but if you think about it, there are times when we all give up our power, we let somebody or something else control us.

A perfect example is really when you're a child, you want somebody to do something for you. You want somebody else to be in control, you don't.

So, we're going to do some further work on this in exploration. So, let's take a few moments and write down what it is that you want firstly, would like to get from wanting to control. And the other thing, what is it you want to get from wanting to be controlled?

(Please pause the videotape and write down what you get from wanting to control, and what you get from wanting to be controlled. Continue when you are ready.)

OK, so let's do some releasing together.

Now. What we'll be doing is identifying the underlying wants with whatever you wrote down and releasing that to completion. Just allowing yourself to be aware of it and letting it go until you've let checked your Let Go column, and you feel good about that particular thing.

So, who would like to work? Whether I'm working with somebody here in this class, or whether you're watching an excerpt from or another class, just follow along. Keep your releasing going. 

Case
Case Michael
(00:14:59)
Nikki: 
Michael, what is it?

What's one thing that you want to get from wanting to control?

Michael: 
Wait a minute. It's What do I get?

Or What do I want to get?

Nikki: What do you want? 

Michael: 
Oh, I just said, what I get from wanting to control?

I get a headache. 

Nikki: All right, 

Michael: what happens often?

Nikki: OK. And when you think of that happening, what does that stirs up?

Your wanting approval, or your wanting to control?

Michael: Feels like approval. 

Nikki: Okay.

Just allow yourself to be aware of the wanting…… you just let it go. (laugh)

All right, okay, just look at it again.

Are you aware of any more of that wanting approval?

Michael: No, no, no. 

Nikki: Okay. Good. Okay, Michael, so what's something that you get from wanting to be control?

Michael: Security.

Nikki: Okay, and can you see whether that's coming from your wanting approval or your wanting to control?

Michael: Control

Nikki: Okey, would you let go? Wanting to control?

Michael: It's got hard. 

Nikki: Okay, does it feel stuck?

OK (laugh) 

Then I'll think about that again.

You wanted security you can get a sense of more of the wanting to control?

Michael: No, not really. Yeah, I went away.

Nikki: Okay, so how are you feeling now about that?

Michael: Pretty good. Pretty good. 

Nikki: Okay, good.

Okay, to write it in your Gains Book. 

Michael: Okay, thank you.


Case Rodney
(00:17:10)
Nikki: 
So, who else would like to work on this sheet is next. What's something somebody gets from wanting to control?

What do you think you're gonna get?

Rodney.

Rodney: 
Ostensibly, I'm looking for power and satisfaction, but Michael said, headache.

Headache, and I just done on me that wanting to control things, I tend to tense up.

My body tends to tense up.

And when you do that, the blood doesn't fall as well.

I probably don't think quite as well, and it may seem like I have a little headache.

So a side effect of that is giving me a little bit of headache too.

Okay, and I'm not thinking it's clearly in this effective ways.

I might otherwise, if if I wasn't trying to hit that control.

OK we'll have some downsides there too.

Nikki: All right. Oh, when you think about that, does it stirred up your wanting approval, or your wanting to control?

Rodney: I think probably control. I tend to be a controlling type person.
I think it got stirs up. (可能)

Nikki: Okay, now that you're aware of what, could you let it go?

Rodney: I’ll try. (laugh)

Nikki: Okay, I just see if you can allow yourself to be aware of the wanting to control.

Rodney: Okay. 

Nikki: But do you allow it to release?

Rodney: Yes. 

Nikki: Okay, so if you can be aware of any more of it there, yeah.

Fact that it gives you a headache, makes you feel stressed?

Rodney: Yes. 

Nikki: Could you allow that wanting to control to release, 

Rodney: Yes, I believe I have the ability to do that, to release that. 

Nikki: Could you?

Rodney: Yes. 

Nikki: Okay, good. Now see if there's any more there.

When you think about…… 

Rodney: Just a little bit, thank you.

Nikki: Yeah. MHM. Just focus on that apartments left. 

Rodney: Residue there. 

Nikki: Is that wanting to control still there?

Okay, could you allow it to release? Good.

Okay. So how is feeling now?

Rodney: Feels better. Okay, better state of mind, happier state of mind.

Nikki: So, on the other side, what's something that you get from wanting to be control?

Rodney: I get approval, 

Nikki: Alright. And is that the wanting approval?

Rodney: Yes, yes.

Nikki: Could you allow that wanting approval to release?

Rodney: Yes, I can.

Nikki: Okay. Can you be aware of any more of it there?

Rodney, the wanting approval? 

Rodney: Still a little bit there.

That's easier released than than the other side for me, for some reason, 

Nikki: Alright.

Rodney: There's still a little bit left there.

Nikki: See, could you let it go?

That want? 

Rodney: Yes. slipped away. (laugh)

Nikki: Alright.

Okay, so you can carry on working on your list is and helping other people.


Case Cheryl
(00:20:30)
Nikki: So, what? 

Cheryl: I get what I want to see my way.

Okay, and what's the underlying want there? The wanting of approval, or wanting to control?

Cheryl: The wanting to control.

Nikki: Yeah, just let it go. 

Cheryl: I don't know I…….

Nikki: Just focus on it again.

The wanting to control, getting what you want.

Cheryl: Um, that part is fine. It's when you think about Okay, so they're saying that, no, you can't have it.

And it's like, well, maybe I didn't get rid of all of it cats and things.

Nikki: All right, so it's good. There's more that than, 

Cheryl: Oh, I'm sure it could come on.

Nikki: Okay. Okay. I just focus on that wanting to control again. Could you allow it to release?

Good. Can you get a sense of any more of it?

That wanting to control.

Cheryl: I think there's probably some approval there.

Nikki: Okay, just allow yourself to be aware of the wanting approval.

Could you allow it to release?

Is there any more of it there?

Cheryl: I guess let some more go.

Nikki: So, when you think of that again, 

Cheryl: I think of somebody telling me, no, I can't have it then.

Yeah, so it does. 

Nikki: Well, when you think about that, is that the wanting to control or wanting approval?

Cheryl: I think it's approval. 

Nikki: All right.

Could you allow the wanting approval to release?

Cheryl: I guess not. (laugh)

Nikki: Are you sure? 

Cheryl: It didn't want to move at all. (laugh)

Nikki: Yeah, just turn back. 

Cheryl: Uh, alright, it looks better.

Nikki: Focus inside again, yeah. See if there is anymore the wanting approval or wanting to control, when somebody says no to you, 

Cheryl: No, it's not even going in my head.

Nikki: Okay. 

Cheryl: I think it's gone. 

Nikki: OK, 

Cheryl: I'll look again.

Nikki: Yes(laugh), just look again. I didn't someone sang that to you?

Cheryl: Yeah, yeah, that's, that's a big one.

It's like, boom. I don't find it.

I think it's gone. I let it all come.

Nikki:  Yeah, that's great. Give up some checks though.

Right now, on the other side, what is it that you want from wanting to be controlled, 

Cheryl: No responsibility, having somebody tell me what to do so that I don't have to worry about it.

Nikki: Alright. And is that coming from the wanting approval, or the wanting to control?

Cheryl: Probably approval, then nobody can say that I did wrong.

Nikki: Okay, just focus on that that wanting approval. No one can say, you did it wrong.

Cheryl: I feel stuck. It's like it's just right here and it's not going to go anywhere.

Nikki: Okay, would you like to control?

Would it stuck right now? 

Cheryl: Yes.

Nikki: Could you let go of wanting to control? 

Cheryl: Okay, 

Nikki: Good. Okay, I'll just think about that again.

Good. Okay, 

Cheryl: Cause I can think about somebody saying that, if it's something wrong and it feels okay, I don't have to feel bad about that.

Nikki: Alright, right, yeah, okay, good.

Thank you to yourself. A couple of check marks there.

Cheryl: Thank you. 

Nikki: Thank you.(laugh) 

Case Terry
(00:25:08)
Nikki: So, who else?

Terry: I feel like I get approval from wanting control.

Oh, okay, so I guess that's approval.

Nikki: Let them go.

There's any more of it there? Terry, that wanting approval. Could you allow it?

Terry: Yes.

Nikki: Okay.

Think you can allow yourself to be aware of more about wanting approval.

Terry: Yeah, I can feel it. 

Nikki: Could you allow it to release?

Terry: Yeah. Okay. I can feel it going.

Of course, don't complete myself. Mhm.

Yeah, no. I Yeah. Okay. I think that's a lot of times when I want to control something, as I, um, feel the need for approval.

Nikki:  Yes, we often want to control people to get approval, 

Terry: you know, to get there, to get all these wonderful things like power and 

Nikki: Yes 

Terry: and the acknowledgment and so forth.
,
That all comes back to approval for me.

Nikki: OK What is there any more?

Terry: Yeah. 

Nikki: Okay, what is that? (laugh)

Terry: There goes another piece.

Nikki: Yeah, good.

Terry: Well, I feel better, I think.

Nikki: Yeah, yeah, sure? 

Terry: yeah, no, I know, I know.

Then. What you get from wanting to be controlled, 

Terry: um, I get acceptance.

Then, if I'm controlled, 

Nikki: okay, 

Terry: approval.(laugh)

Okay, I guess I get to release a little more than 

Nikki: just the flip side.

MHM Yeah, we do have bones.

Just this side. Isn't often, is obvious?

Terry: It's amazing how much approval there is on a wanting control sheet.

Nikki: Yeah. Very often. Know about the ones there, though.

Mhm. So just focus inside again.

Terry: Okay, 

Nikki: could you let it go?

Love you as at home, so those of you at home, just get comfortable and pick something from your worksheet that you're wanting to get from Wanting to Control,

Just see, what want is underlying that, said the wanting approval, or your wanting to control, Could you allow it to release?

Spoke us again? So, if there's any more of that there, whichever want it was, and could you allow it to release?

And when you think of that thing that you think you're going to get from wanting to control. just allow whatever is want - whatever the want is there, just come into your awareness, and could you allow it to release? And take a look at that again. Some more of that want there. Could you let it go? 

And when you think about what you want to get from wanting to control. Just see what want is there right now? Could you allow it to release? Just see if there's any more of it there. And whichever one is there, could you let it go?

Now, let's go to the other side now. It's something that you want from wanting to be controlled.

Just see what want is underline that? The wanting approval or the wanting to control? Could you allow it to release?

Just check again. Is there any more of that want there? Could you let it go? 

Just check again. What want is there right now? Is it the wanting approval or the wanting to control? Could you allow it to release? Just think again, when you think about what it is that you want to get from wanting to be controlled.

Just allow whatever want is there is to come into your awareness. Just allow yourself to be aware of it.

Could you allow it to release? And just one more time, check and see if there's any more of it there, and could you let it go?

Okay, Now, continue working on these sheets, taking the things that you want to get from wanting to control and things that you want to get from wanting to be controlled, and keep releasing whatever want comes up and letting that go until you feel good. And then make sure you check on each side of the column there. They'll Let Go and the Feel Good.

Worksheet – Wanting Approval
(00:36:07)
 
图表 4 Wanting Approval
Nikki: 
Now, we're going to do the same thing again, but this time with the wanting approval.

So those of you at home and those of you here, turn to the page in your book, this is Wanting Approval.

And the Wanting Approval has two sides to it also.

We think we're going to get certain things from wanting approval, but on the other side, there are times when we want disapproval.

You might want to think of it a little bit in terms of the rebel.

You all know somebody who's a kind of a rebel and likes disapproval.

Once disapproval. Well, that's part of it us, that has that inside too.

So, we're going to explore that, just the wanting disapproval and the wanting approval.

So, I'm going to give you a few moments here to write down some of the things again, what do you get from wanting approval, and what do you get from wanting disapproval?

(Please pause the videotape and write down what you get from wanting approval, and what you get from wanting disapproval. Continue when you are ready.)

Let's find out what you got down here in the terms of the wanting approval and the wanting disapproval.

And those of you at home, just keep releasing with whoever I'm releasing with, and keep your focus on that.

So, who would like to go to 1st?

Case
Case Michael
(00:37:33)
Nikki: Michael? What do you get from waning approval?

Michael: Em, disappointment. 

Nikki: OK And what does that stirred up?

The wanting approval or the wanting to control?

Michael: Control.

Nikki: Alright, could you let go wanting to control.

Michael: (laugh) Yes I can.

Nikki: Okay, is there any more of that day?

When you think about it, you get disappointment, 

is more releasing? 

Michael: Disappointment too. 

Nikki: Can you get a sense of more of that wanting to control there? 

Michael: We have wanting to control the disappointment.

Nikki: Yeah. Could you let it go?

Michael: (laugh) Yeah.

Nikki: Okay, see if there is anymore. 

Michael: It's pretty good.

Nikki: Alright, so let's move to the other side then.

What is it you get from wanting disapproval?

Michael: I get a lot of confidence.

Nikki: Oh, okay. And is that wanting approve?

Or wanting to control? 

Michael: Um, yeah, like self approval.

Nikki: Okay, could you allow that wanting approval to release?

Michael: It's control, that's what it is. (laugh)

Nikki: Okay, just allow yourself to be aware of any wanting to control that good and letting it go.

When you think about it, give me confidence.

There anymore wanting to control that?

Or wanting approval that? 

Michael: Now. I feel controlled.

I don't think it's wanting to feel control.

Maybe that's wanting to control. I don't know. (laugh)

Nikki: I'm sitting now. Confidence you want to do before, and you think about wanting disapproval and the confidence that you feel like, 

Michael: yeah, I feel it does give me.

Nikki: The truth is, in fact, it's when you let go of wanting it, and you have approval, 

for yourself and for others. But that's when you do feel comfortable. You're not wanting to try and get it from someplace or someone else.

You have it right inside of you. And so, in fact, when you are released and you're not wanting it, that's really when you have it.

So, you're feeling ok? 

Michael: Yeah, super (laugh)

Nikki: Thank you yourself.

And check that writing in Gains Book.

So, who is the next?

Cheryl: Yeah.

Nikki: Can can you feel any more of it there?

That writing approval? See, could you allow it to release?

Cheryl: I'm sorry, 

Nikki: good, (laugh) (听不清)

Can you feel more of it there that wanting to control?

Dave: There's a lot of it there.

Nikki: Would you like to control? How much?

Dave: Yeah, over time.

Nikki: What would you like to control?

How much there is there? It's built up over time.

Dave: Never thought I would like that. Probably.

Nikki: Uh-huh. Could you allow that to release?

OK So, anymore wanting to control that?

How much is, accumulated? 

Dave: It's better.

Nikki: Okay, 

Dave: it is better. 

Nikki: Good. 

Well, look at that thing again and see if there's any more wanting to control.

Are any wanting approval? 

Dave: More wanting control?

Nikki: Okay, could you like, uh-huh, yeah.

You like golf a lot, but just that part that's laughed.

Just let yourself be aware of the wanting to control.

Could you let it go? 

Dave: Yeah, I could let it go.

Have the feeling that I want to hold onto some of it, though.

Nikki: Oh, would that be for control or approval?

Dave: Control.(laugh)

Nikki: Okay, 

Dave: that's better. 

Nikki: Okay, 

Dave: much better.

You know, it's the, um, it's the same decision that we use to hold on to a feeling or to let it go.

It's actually the same thing. You know, often I could ask you, could you hold on to a feeling?

Yeah, fine. You know, it's the same thing.

If I asked you, could you let it go?

It's exactly the same decision that you use to let it go.

Dave: Okay, thank you, that’s good.

Nikki: Get yourself a couple of checks there.

Nikki: 
Okay, so let's do some releasing now with a home viewer, and you can all keep just working on focusing on this, allowing whatever wants are there in the moment, just to release.

OK So just get comfortable. Find something on your list that you want to get from wanting approval, whatever that thing is, see what the underlying want is that's connected with it.

Is it the wanting approval? Or the wanting to control?

Could you allow that want to release?

Just look again. See any more of that want there? Could you let it go? And when you think what you want to get from wanting approval, to see what want is there now in the moment,
