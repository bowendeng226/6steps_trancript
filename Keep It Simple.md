# Keep It Simple – Lester Levenson

Good morning.

Talking about relationships, the sweetest, sweetest kiss of all kisses (Laugh) is a kiss of freedom. And in order to get that kiss of freedom, you must understand the word kiss, K-I-S-S, keep it simple, sweetheart, (Laugh) if you will latch on to catch hold of absorb understand that simplicity is the way to understanding the ultimate. It will expedite you're getting there tremendously.

Keep it simple, sweetheart. It is so simple when you discover it, only then you know it's the simplest of all simples thyself by inner beingness, your business, your amorous. Knowing which you will know every besides being in the highest, most delectable state there is. And everything you're seeking externally, unconsciously is looking for this ultimate state.

And **you'll never, ever stop chasing it and banging yourself against the wall of the world, until you discover it by stopping banging yourself against the world**, going within and discovering exactly what it is that you are. But you must keep it simple to get to this simplest of all simples, your very own self.

**The way to that place is so simple. All you need to do is quiet the mind.** It's your mind. You made it noisy. You can quiet it. Get that mind totally quiet, and that's it. Is that hard to understand? A quiet mind puts you in touch with the all-powerful, all knowing-being that you are. Quieting the mind does it. Is there anyone here who cannot understand that? Mind quiet, that's it. 

When your mind is quiet, yourself obvious to yourself, and you are in touch with all the power in the universe as being within you. You are in touch with all the knowledge there is which is within you. It comes right from your beingness, which you will not quiet your mind for one moment to see. If you would quiet your mind for just one moment, you would see this, and thereafter pursue only it. So, to be smart we need this kiss theory to keep it simple. You're trying to get out and overcomplications in running hither, thither to everywhere where it isn't, and where is it? Right where you are. 

The reason why we're not going free, we're not reaching the ultimate is we’re not quieting the mind. And for hundreds and thousands of years, they’ve been telling us what to do. They tell you quiet the mind, but they have not given us the how-to, which is so simple.

Now, your mind is active 24 hours a day on guard in order that you survive. All those programs called apathy, grief, fear, lust, anger and so forth, every one of them is a survival program. So, you're constantly on guard 24 hours a day with hundreds of thoughts, which you have very foolishly relegated to the background. And you don't look at them and you say, they're unconscious, taking no responsibility for them, even though you have tied them up back there. You locked them into a closet called the unconscious. This claiming responsibility for it. Take responsibility for all this accumulated AGFLAP in your subconscious mind, then you can start doing away with it.

The mind will never, ever give you the answer, and you're looking forward via the mind. The expression is, you're trying to cross the river by grabbing hold of an alligator. (Laugh) It'll never take it across the river. (Laugh) You must start quieting that mind. 

And the thing that quiets the mind, is no thoughts, and what motivates all thinking feelings, and all feelings superficial culminating to the heavier feelings that we call AGFLAP. The AGFLAP culminates into two, called approval, control, which culminated to one, called survival, security. **When we rid ourselves of wanting approval or wanting control, we rid ourselves of all the AGFLAP and hundreds of other feelings.** They're out of the subconscious, and the mind is quiet. And then we are coming from our infinite beingness, working intuitively, which is simply saying we're coming from our omniscience. That's all intuition is. All this intellectual knowledge that we work through our mind is coming through ignorance. Ignorance is the fact that just behind the mind is our omniscience. Ignorance of the fact that everything we do via the mind is limited and hurts. Every thought has a certain amount of limitation to it and covers over the unlimited being that we are.

So, we need a method that will pull out the motivation of all thinking, which is called feelings, and that will quiet the mind. The mind will never quiet the mind because the mind is a mechanism of falsely looking for survival, security, approval, control.

And as long as a mind is a mechanism for that, it will never, ever give you the right answer. It will forever keep you running after the wrong answers. And you get moments of pleasure and long periods of pain. But you must keep it simple. You are the ultimate-being, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.

Acting with extreme limitation, held within the mind, pushed back into a closet called the unconscious and acting as oh, I didn't do it. And if it comes up, we don't like it, we try to push it back in the closet.

**The way is simple, and the way is easy. Let the feelings come up, get them under approval or control and let them out. Carry out the six steps of the method, it will take you months to empty out the totality of your garbage.** After which, life becomes a near effortless, beautiful, harmonious, almost dream. Everything comes to us with no effort. By just merely placing a thought in our quiet mind, it will manifest. Not immediately quickly, and you'll never, ever stop struggling until you do that.

So why not now? Why not the next few months? Get smart. Remember the kiss theory. As we break it down into three parts. There's this infinite eye that I am, all knowing, all powerful, everywhere present, right now, always was, always will be.

And how much of it are you living? Isn't that silly? What it takes to get to know that? Is just the result that this is better than this. A body with sickness but constant attention to keep it surviving, fighting a battle that's an absolutely no-win battle. Where are all these buddies going to be a hundred years from now? How smart are we to spend all our time surviving this body? When we know it's not gonna survive, intelligence should be defined as the ability to be happy. Psychology defines it as the ability to resolve problems. It should be the ability to be happy, the ability to be happiest. And what we intelligent, we would be the happiest. And were we intelligent, we would be the happiest.

Everything we're fighting for, struggling for out there in this world is already ours, and we're running away from it, chasing after it where it isn’t. I'm sure some of you have seen this. People have seen what I'm saying. OK, why aren't you free? (Laugh) Why don’t you set a limited being? 

**Audience:** Some more things in the world. 

Right. You want these stupid things in the world which you think, I'm gonna give you this and again, and again, and again and again, every day, year in a year out. It doesn't give it to you. You never stop struggling for that which you are externally. You've gotta make that U-turn, you gotta stop chasing it out there, make you turn right back on you and see you the way you really are, whole complete, omnipotent omniscient, omnipresent. This is what you're struggling for near every act out there called happiness, security, whatever.

You'll never, ever stop until you get to fully identifying yourself as to what you really are. This is the changeless you. It's perfect. You cannot do a thing to it except look away from it. But you can't do a thing to it.

So, get intelligent, get all that happiness there is in the universe, get to the ultimate state. Get out of the struggle and let yourself just be and be and be. So here we are, this infinite beingness and we set up a mechanism called Mind, which the world thinks is so complicated, they go through college courses and get doctorates, and they don't know what it is after so many years of study. And all it is, is the sum total collection of our thoughts and feelings. The mind is a very simple thing. It's the totality of all our thoughts and feelings. You know what I thought, my feeling is? That's what mind is. And the majority of it, we don't look at. It's unpleasant. So, we called unconscious. We set up this mind, which sets up the body. The only place you can see your body for any other body is in your mind. It is nowhere else. And a proof of that is every time you go to sleep, out goes your body and every other body. When I say, don't wake up, there's never any more bodies, but you are. We’re only possible to do that, that’d be great. Go to sleep, dreamless sleep, and don't wake up. You would become aware of the fact that you are, your beingness. It's impossible to do it that way.

We program this thing in, and like the astronaut in 2001, he went into the computer. That's all our mind is, is a computer. Start pulling out the banks, and those banks are apathy, grief, fear, lust, anger. Those are all the programs. Pull them out, and you'll just be. Quiet that mind, and then you're aware of being in this state. 

And remember, the mind will never quiet the mind. That's why all the ways that have been tried for thousands of years don't work. They're all trying to do it within mind. Mind is the enemy and will not do it. We must quiet that mind by quieting the motivation of the mind called feelings.

Now, in all these feelings route to the highest love are all non-love feelings. That's why the world is in such a destructive direction. But their act, as I started to say, all feeling relative to love are not love feelings, and are destructive. All AGFLAP is destructive. Remember, underneath the AGFLAP, everyone is a Christ. Everyone is all love. And the only thing covering up this all lovingness of ours is the AGFLAP.

But you know what? You can transcend a hydrogen bomb. You can make yourself untouchable by a hydrogen bomb. How the absolute conviction the hydrogen bomb cannot touch me will do it. You’re seeing some of these things coming out in the world, and things like fire walking. We've had a few classes, I think in Sedona here, where the teachers taken people over red-hot coals barefooted, people get themselves a nice high state, absolutely convinced that they can do it, and they just come we walk over the red-hot coals. Just a thought. That's all it is.

Can anyone have a thought here? (Laugh) It's just a thought. But see that goes for everything. You can withstand a hydrogen bomb in the exact same way. You see you can override momentarily the subconscious negativity. But you need to eliminate that negativity to have that ability for all time. Whenever you think is, this is the funny thing that's going on all the time. There's nothing out there but your thought. Again, that's proven by going to sleep. All that out there disappears when you go to sleep. Where is it? It's in your mind. It's your mind that says, is a character up to a Lester talking to you. Put your mind asleep. I'm gone. Don't wake up. And gone forever. But you'll remain like you do every morning when you come out of a deep sleep. You see how simple it is.

Keep it simple. There's nothing out there but your thought. Everything happening is your thought. Most of what's happening is negative. Get rid of your thought. How? Get rid of your mental action by quieting, quieting the mind to where there’s no thoughts, unless you choose to put a thought in. It’s simple, and it's easy, you just make that choice.

When you want freedom, when you decide you want freedom more than you want everything else you've gotten in life, I mean everything else, relationships, wherewithal. When you want freedom more than you want those things, you get it quickly. Also, when you see that the only reason why you want that is to have that freedom. That'll help you make that decision, they’re going after that ultimate state of security, the wrong way externally, the only way you'll ever get it is inward.

And once you have that, nothing in this universe could touch it. Once you don’t see is you're experiencing exactly your mental picture. You're some total thinking this, which includes all the unconscious thinking this, which is 95% of your thinking this now. That's all you're experiencing is your sum total thinking is the conscious and the unconscious together.

But you got to keep it simple, get to see this, and then work to undo that mind activity by ridding yourself of your feelings. And when you do that, you’re in the highest state of love there is, which is the natural state. 南无观世音菩萨
