# The Way, Part 5

**Lester:** There's nothing you have to do to be totally free, anything like that. Why? Right now, you're totally free. You're all-powerful. You're all-knowing. You're everywhere present. You’re whole-complete, perfect right now. There’s nothing you have to do for that.

So, says I, why will this effort to be unfree, limited, and miserable? Why? Why? Or why or why? All you need to do is yet after these suppressed energies, I am limited, I am in bondage, I am miserable. By letting up and letting out approval, control, and security. You’ve done it. (Not clear). Be done with it. You'll be in a happy state that you never dreamed existed. You've never tasted the ultimate state yet.

You don't have to do a thing to be free because you're already free. You have to stop this asinine conviction that you're suffering body that's going to die, they gotta keep, trying to keep it alive until it dies. It drop lying (Not clear). You will not win. So, let go of all this concept about my limited carcass. 

How long should it take? A month or two? If you carry out the six steps. I think the step, the steps that you're lacking most, is that the very first step. And I know what the first step is. (Laugh) You gotta want freedom more than you want the world. None of you want the freedom more than you want the world. Where it’s so, you'd be free. It's that simple. To be what you are, so easy. But if any one of you wanted freedom more than you want the world, you’d be free.

So, you’re out on step one. You can't get over the first step to go the next five. But when I heard is enough, you release enough to get rid of that hurt. So, you can try going on looking to the world for your absolute security. But you will never find in the world which you will only find in you. So, get smart, be what you are. Why all this effort and misery to be what you are not? There's a 100% loss in the direction you're in, where all these bodies going to be a hundred years from now.

Everything you're doing is trying to keep the body going. And if I were to wish you a curse, the greatest one I could think of as to be a physical body. I think the only other one who says that is Ramana Maharshi. W That the worst curse it would be that condemn you into being a physical body from here on. It's like condemning you into being in a straitjacket from here on.

So, I try to give you, in all those first meetings we had when we started this project, very practical things that can get you free quickly. And the last one is such a powerful one, I think I'm not going to give you any more practical things to do, because it'll confuse and jumble what you've already got. What have you gotten? Those signs in your room. Get everything you want only by releasing. Is it worked? Kevin, are you getting everything now?

**Student:** (Not clear)

**Lester:** But everything you do want, you should get by releasing. Do you have that in place?

**Student:** (Not clear)

**Lester:** Okay. When you have everything in place, you have the sense of not being the doer. When you're getting everything by releasing, you become a witness, whereas before you were a doer of it. You just witness your body going through its motions with a complete sense of non-doership, which should be spelled with a “t” instead of a “p”. (Laugh)

See, that makes it effortless when you're not the doer. The zero effort, and it, and it happens harmoniously and immediately. What are the other three or four steps I gave you before that last one, you remember what…… 

**Student:** (Not clear)

**Lester:** Yeah, and that is a practical things. Be successful in whatever it is you're doing, it's digging a hole, pulling up some rocks, whatever it is, be successful. Whatever it is you do. What was another one?

**Student:** (Not clear) All your happiness and joy from, from within. (Not clear)

**Lester:** Yeah, recognize that all the joy you get is from getting your mind quiet by satisfying a desire and just being your beingness. There is only one single joy. That's when you're being your beingness.

But you set up a lack, a want, a desire to agitate the mind only fulfill those desire, the mind goes quiet, and you're just being that's the joy you feel. There’s no other joy. So, get all your joy from your beingness.

There's still one more. 

**Student:** (Not clear)

**Lester:** I'm just wondering if that is fourth…... (Not clear) Bring up the fear of dying. That'll goes for you if you'll do it. But you're not free now, so you didn't do it. (Laugh)

The all the suppressed fear of dying right now is trying to push up and push out. You just stop holding it in on its own little bit or go out (Not clear), but I still recommend using to the degree you can use it, and you have no more fear of dying. Your mind goes quiet. You're identifying with your beingness, and you're free. Nice and simple, nice and easy.

The only difficulty is trying to be a limited carcass. That's where all your difficulty is, all your misery. Everything you do now want is involved in trying to be a limited body.

So, discriminate, my son. Yogeshwar said the Yogananda when he left him after his return, recognize the world as a dream. That’s all it is. You’re dreaming this whole thing, exactly I could be dreaming a night dream. Wake up and see it for the dream that it is. And the infinitely happy. 

Are there any questions…… (Not clear) 

It’s really give me the very top knowledge in a most practical way you could ever get it. Those different steps are very practical. Of course, being out here is another one of the steps. Living with people who release, living with people that you can express on and both of you release, as I said again and again, I'm convinced you'll never go free in the world.

The world is too powerfully pulling everyone down into the worldly way of things. You need to get away from that pole. Work together as a group. Use your expressing for releasing in the world. And you wanted to go out, that you have to suppress, otherwise you'll get killed. You express your anger to the wrong person who shoots you. It's not beat you up. It gets better that way every day. They gather hundreds of policemen in California patrolling the streets to stop the gang slight (Not clear). Yesterday there were three killings by the gangs in Los Angeles.

You can't stop it out there, but you have a wonderful opportunity here of expressing, releasing and moving onward and w upward. 

Again, any questions on anything I've said? How did you all understand it so well? When I come back next week? Expect to see two, four, six, eight, three people, or else. (Laugh)

**Student:** (Not clear) (Laugh)

**Lester:** You know the word “God” means in the language. What gone tops. (Not clear) OK, there's no more…… 

**Student:** There’s a question. I know that you can get to I see the I'm not sure I have the same visit, remembering by (Not clear)

**Lester:** Well, the shortcut, you simply this way. It's only your mind that says there's a Lester here, and there's still there (Not clear). Right? 

**Student:** When you're in a night-dream, you don't sense material or the daydream things have followed, touched them.

**Lester:** You have formed the night-dream. You've got your body, you got other bodies. 

**Student:** But it doesn't feel like I have it. (Not clear)

**Lester:** When you're in a dream state, you're in a dream body. Of course, you're not in the physical body. You're not in that state. But this is what you're saying.

**Student:** I have a problem…… (Not clear)

**Lester:** No. And you do wake up from the night-dream. You do not wake up from this daydream.

**Student:** This is my problem (Not clear), 

**Lester:** Because you're so convinced, W that this daydream is real, that you're in it. And we'll let it go, release it, then you'll see the dream nature of this physical world. Release it. If you're holding on it for dear life (Not clear), like you are, you're not releasing it. You're doing the opposite. That's why you don't see it as a dream. The same in a night-dream when you're struggling for your life. My dream is going on. It's real.

It's only after you wake up from the dream that you know it's unreal. You've got to wake up from this dream by letting go of your tight holding onto it, by releasing it, then it would be very obvious to you that this so-called waking state is exactly as real as a night-dream is real. But you gotta wake up. 

**Student:** I’ve experienced it. (Not clear)

**Lester:** Release the back part of it. It's only it will remain permanently. Or release one thing, the fear of dying, that'll take care of everything. One thing only you got to release one thing only, the fear of dying.

You don't do it. You can discovery your omnipotent, omniscient. You can have anything you want from your effortless thought of it. You materialize, dematerialize. You can teleport, you can tell the past, you can tell anything you want.

**Student:** That seems like some direct opposition to being the doer, which I'm listening towards being not the doer…… (Not clear) 

**Lester:** Okay, to be in that state. You can only be in it when you know you're not the doer.

**Student:** Say, tomorrow morning I wake up on I can't say I'm gonna be a witness to…… (Not clear)

**Lester:** You can’t say it. You can be it only 

**Student:** So…… 

**Lester:** see to be your beingness, the top states being your beingness only. You can't say it, anything you say is in duality, is in a dream. 

**Student:** The day-to-day action that I might be in process of with, there might be some goal that I might release on totally (Not clear)

**Lester:** Yeah, you letting go of your attachments and aversions to the world, bit by bit, by bit by bit, which needs a big bite instead of a bit of a bit.

So, you use what you're doing for releasing, see the only effort you need is to get rid of your effort. This is what you're doing in the world. You're using effort to get rid of the effort. But in your beingness you need no effort. Things materialize and dematerialize instantly. 

But you're trying to figure it out in your head. You cannot, because your head, your mind, your intellect, is the obstacle, the accumulation of the concepts of limitation. So, you can't figure it out on your head. You can be your beingness. You are being it right now, but you don't have to be in a limited carcass. This is what you're releasing as you work and go through the day. It releases all the attachments and versions by getting rid of the emotion connecting you to it.

I answer your question? 

**Student:** Yes, it was especially I don't feel like I'm trying to figure it out, but I can see I can't jump the bottom. You did answer by…… 

**Lester:** You can figure it out 

**Student:** by day to day, by release moment to moment, or I can sure type of whole thing by release fear of dying, that's pretty much 

**Lester:** Right. Still facing approval, control is also sure cutting it. Instead of going through all those emotions below approval, control. When you have no more either approval or control, all the emotions below that are gone, but you'll still have approval, control until you release the fear of dying. 

The only reason why you want everyone’s approval is, so you'll be safe and survive. You can't get that. You want to make them approve of you, so you'll be safe and that's control. 

But when you let go of approval or control, all the things underneath it are out. Then left is just approval or control, which is let go of by letting go the fear of dying. But when you're that far, it's easy to let the fear dying come up. They reach a point where it'll just push up and push out, and you'll sit back and watch it complete itself, discharging itself, and you'll laugh your head off. What a silly joke you played upon yourself to think that you were limited when you never were.

OK, any other questions? Okay, so we'll call the day of eternity.

I don't want to.
