# The Way, Part 2

**Lester:**  
Don't do halfway jobs. You discover a free one does that naturally. Whatever the free one does, he or she does it to perfection. So, it's a very practical tool. Whatever you do, no matter what it is, 

**Audience:**  
(Not clear)

**Lester:**  
they do it so that you’re free in no time flat.

How long should it take to be what you are right now? That's how much time it should take to go free. You're free right now in your beingness. You're bound in your ego sense. I took out it from one of my life, something I could, maybe next time, I'll give it to you.

Now, work is no hindrance to realization. Doing things does not block you from realization. It is the sense of wrong identification that is the source of all your trouble. Get rid of the false identification. What's the false identification? 

**Audience:**  
You are the doer.

**Lester:**  
You are the doer. When you’ve all experienced from releasing. When you're released, it happens. You're not the doer. As I told down, like when Yogananda was sitting in a bed, it was very high. He didn't try to get his balance, raise his hand, and went up effortlessly.

When you're not the doer and you want your hand to go up, it just floats up with no effort. And everything you do; the same thing happens. No energy, no effort is necessary.

So being in action is no hindrance. The hindrance is identifying as being the limited body mind, as I identify with them, ego. 

If you tried to do no action. You wouldn't succeed. Because your karma is driving you now into action. So, the, you tried to do nothing, you wouldn’t succeed. Whatever your karma is, you would do. So, trying to do nothing doesn't help. Only releasing helps. And only releasing will get you all the way as fast as you will do it.

So, the action, rather than being a hindrance, is really a help, because as you're in action, you're being pushed by your feelings, which bring up more feelings while you're in action for you to release all your feelings. So, you must do it in the world. You must do it in action. You cannot do it isolating. When you isolate, you just escape.

So, the next major point to write down on your slips, or whatever you got, is, “Whatever you do, do it to perfection”. That's behaving like a master. Behaving like a master brings up the objections to it for your releasing. If you don't do things to perfections, it’s because actually you're destructive destructiveness, you’re non constructiveness, it closes you to do it, not to perfection. But if you make it a point to do it to perfection, overcome these feelings that are anti while you are releasing.

So, make it a point to do whatever you're doing very successfully. That word “perfection” might not be understood, “success” might be better understood. Whatever you do, you should be successful in doing it.

OK, I think I gave you enough for today. These points are so potent. Any one of them that we've had will extremely expedite your going-free, a very practical and right down to earth, and how to behave in your everyday life. You'll be doing up in your everyday life, things that get you free, rather than what you're doing now. What you're doing now keeps you bound in the round and around and around you go. You're on a merry-go-round. If you do these things, you’ll get off the merry-go-round, you'll stop spinning.

(The following session was recorded June 4th, 1989.)

**Student:**  
I'm a private session? (Not clear)

**Lester:**  
Okay, I could give it to you from here on, every time I meet, if you won't kill me, (Laugh) I could always keep pointing out things that you're doing that keep you going in the wrong direction of limitation.

**Student:**  
One like, why don't we try that? Not if anybody also in agreement, but you always talked about, in a days when you were giving ego presentation, people grew rapidly. So, why don’t we try that is that something that would help us grow?

**Lester:**  
Grew? I'm glad you brought it up. I don't think so (Laugh) because what happened before was that every one of them stopped growing, stopped dead. It’s a whole gang that was out there.

**Student:**  
They didn't have a release technique either, did they?

**Lester:**  
Em, right. They didn't have, yes, they did. I give it to them one on one all the time, without putting them through the formal course. And, yeah, they all had it before we broke up.

**Student:**  
Yeah, before, but not long before. 

**Lester:**  
OK, they could have released. 

**Student:**  
Australia (Not clear).

**Lester:**  
They didn’t. Now, I know what happened after it happens, I can see the cause of it. If I give you ego presentation more than you want it, you unconsciously build up a resistance to hearing anything I have to say after a while, you stop growing, period.

So, there's a delicate balance. I can do it lightly like the way I'm doing it now is not as heavy as the ego presentation used to be, but I'll try it. Let's see what happens. 

**Student:**  
(Laugh) (Not clear)

**Student:**  
You talk about trying them, but I'd better have to say, over the last month or so, you definitely turn the heat up from what you had to.

So what's your have? You ask? (Not clear)

Geographics. (Not clear)

**Lester:**  
That's another problem. That's another problem I have. I think I'm gonna do something.

A higher power says, otherwise, (Laugh) when you go free, your thinking-mechanism is overridden by the highest beingness called God. What are we gonna ask?

**Student:**  
That's, I guess something. Who is, I mean, the higher self or God?

**Lester:**  
The bottom line, it's you. Ramana Maharshi says, at times there is no God. There's you. Show me God. Can you show me? Anyone here can show me God? Have you ever seen God? Never get a letter from him. (Laugh) Never shake his hand. So, he says, there's no God, but there's you.

And in your beingness, you are that God that you're conjuring up. Your beingness is what the world calls God. And when you release your egos sense and drop into your beingness, you're all knowing, you're all powerful, and you're everywhere present. Isn't that simple? Isn't that nice? What a present I gave you. Your God, your God, your God, your God, your God, your God. God darn (Laugh).

Go again. I could think it on there, but you can see why I can talk that way. Is there a God? Sure, I'm looking at him, and that's what you're looking at all the time, saying otherwise. I can condemn him the hell, wish them every bad thing there is. But not really, because it's me, my beingness. So when I voice it to you. I really don't mean it, anything derogatory. Is there a God? Yeah, thou art that on the East, from the West. I AM THAT I AM. I'm still not sure if that's the only capitalized sentence.

(Door sound)

Come in (Laugh), that's God. (Laugh)

**Student:**  
Get him close the door. 

**Lester:**  
Hey, Georgie Burns, close the door. (Door sound) (Laugh)

I just went to prove God is one (Laugh), not me.

They enjoy burns. (Laugh) He's just acting like one.

She was trying to hold onto his eternality through the physical body. He is in his 90s now, and they still gets on stage and, special shows, so gets up talk things, dances, at least, he thinks he's dancing.

Just about moves W. Anyway, God is a one single, infinite beingness of the universe, therefore that must include us. It's the part of us that's our beingness. It's a car coming. 

**Student:**  
(Not clear)

**Lester:**  So, I got thrown off. I don't want mopeds around here go cause we have enough. They don't have to any mopeds to it. No, I was thinking, how to stop outside people from coming in with the proper sign. I think, cattle guard. 

**Student:**  
And your radioactivity.

**Lester:**  
What about “Beware of the dog”? (Laugh) Whoever stops them says, I am the dog.

**Student:**  
(Not clear) (Laugh) (Barking) Woof.

**Lester:**  
Why don't we put up an electronic system, put up the sign “Beware of the Dog”. And if they walk in, they break an electronic beam, which plays a very loud barking. (Laugh) We have to get a real dog on tape. Anyway, someday we'll have to have, the reception is out at an entrance point. When the traffic gets heavier. 

**Student:**  
We could easily put an electronic gate and a little voice thing when you have to enter calm, you press it if you want to end. Otherwise, people that know could get in easily without even getting out of their car, so.

**Lester:**  
Em. Maybe that's a better idea. And give it to Frank and his people. 

**Student:**  
Yeah, he won't cost four or five hundred dollars for the gate.

**Lester:**  
Well, the way we like to waste money, I don't know. (Laugh) Who was, what are the two Indians one last week. 

**Student:**  
They never came there.

**Lester:**  
My scalp is my own. And I've got to lift that. Nancy told me yesterday, or a day before, insurance cannot be granted. And I said, papers lift it. So, when I get back to town, I go to work at and try to lift it where I sure can shift from the top to the bottom. What were we talking about? 

**Student:**  
God being here?

The crowds of dogs? 

**Lester:**  
Yeah, it was a God.

**Student:**  
(Not clear)

**Lester:**  
I said, yeah, I'm working at it. But I look at you, and I see God. You say, no, Lester, you're a liar. I'm an extreme limited carcass. If my temperature goes up 10 degrees, I die. If I get a chemical in me, I die. I don't put in vegetation to ferment it and make garbage out of it, I die. (Laugh) This is what you say. No, I am not the unlimited being. I’m a caucus, and someday you'll see you imaged it in your mind, needing all these little limitations.

So, what do you need to do? I summed up the four days sessions we had before. The first one was “You want the world more than you want freedom”, and with it, you should take all your joy from yourself, from within by releasing.

That was session No.1. Session No.2 was “You must make the decision to go free and then do it”. However, if you make the decision to go free, you will do it. That's simple. If you're not free, you have not made the decision to go free. Because once you make the decision, everything you do after that is orientated toward going free.

The prime thing of is making releasing constant.

The 3rd session was “Go directly to the fear of dying and release it”. Release directly the fear of dying. As you know, underneath approval and control is the fear of dying. So, get rid of the bottom motivator, you finished. 

The 4th one was “Get everything you want from here on by releasing”. I guess that is the most practical of the four. How successful have you been? I still don't. Mostly ego eyes. Remember, when you do it by releasing, its effortless. If you're making an effort, that's ego motivated. 

**Student:**  
Just I get confused about the action part of it, you're just saying it's effortless. You still body acts to get it. But it's without. 

**Lester:**  
Yes, it's without effort. It's like floating through the air, floating through the thing. As I explained, if you wanted to lift your arm up, it takes nowhere. It just floats up. No energy is required. So, effortless, this is when I say, I am not the doer, and I let it happen. Another way of expressing is, is letting go and letting God. But your actual experience, there is no effort. 

**Student:**  
It makes it a lot clearer, because we could actually go through the body, could go through all the actions of the day doing things. And yet the effortless if we stay released.

**Lester:**  
Right, that's it. I think the last time didn't I read something that Ramana said, uh, action doesn't stop one from realization, identifying as the doer does.

So bottom line, it sums up to “I am my beingness”. And when you come from your beingness, you'll just watch the bodies float around, including your own, exactly as you would watch them on a movie screen. And when bodies on a movie screen start shooting, even bullets wiping each other out, you know it for what it is. Just an imagined thing. There's no dead. You can imagine image there. Actually. There is no such thing as that. Get rid of the imaging, get rid of the imagination, you get rid of the mind.

And all I'm saying to you is very obvious. And again, you'll never stop struggling until you do go all the way to freedom. These 4 sessions, the first 4 sessions are so powerful. I decided not to add to it. I could go on with more things like that. I think it would get to be maybe a little more confusing, and if I leave it as it is, it's simpler to understand and do.

So, we can go on talking about things related to this rather than new things. I don't want to over complicated because that's one of your serious problems. We've got everything over complicated right now. Life is simple. It's eternal. It's perfect. It's whole. Isn't that simple? Why are, why pile things into their head? I take you away from what I just said.

Every thought is a limitation. Every thought, it's calculated to keep your body surviving. Every thought keeps you bound and around. So, you must start thinking how, release the fear of dying, and you don't have to struggle for survival anymore. Release the fear of dying, and you discover you are eternal. And all that misery conjured up was ridiculous.

Okay, I feel like stopping it right there, because again, I'm saying so much to you, making it so simple. Now I’m telling you you are, and you can't do anything about that, and trying to stop looking otherwise elsewhere. Put into your own beingness.
